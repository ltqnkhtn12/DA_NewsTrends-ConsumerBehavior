Python: I led a data analysis project focused on understanding internet news dynamics and predicting consumer engagement. Leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle, I explored various aspects of online articles, including publishers, authors, publication times, and user interaction metrics.

Tasks:
- Explored and visualized data to identify top publishers and authors based on content volume and engagement metrics.
- Analyzed engagement metrics distribution to understand user interaction patterns.
- Utilized text analysis techniques to extract insights from article titles and descriptions.
- Implemented machine learning models to predict consumer engagement based on article features.
- Summarized findings and provided actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
Skills Demonstrated:
- Data analysis and visualization using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- Text analysis techniques (word clouds, sentiment analysis) for content insights.
- Machine learning modeling (classification, regression) for engagement prediction.
- Communication and presentation skills for summarizing findings and recommendations.
